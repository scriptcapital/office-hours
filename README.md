# office-hours
A reference for regular office hours between founders and early stage investors 

## audience
Typically a 1:1 between the founding CEO and largest investor. Possibly include 1 other co-founder max. 

## cadence
Typically early stage companies should be holding some type of live conversation with a meaningful external stakeholder happen 1x per week to 1x per month. For pre-product or pre-revenue companies we like to hold office hours every 1-2 weeks. For companies with some early revenue and metrics, typically 1-2x per month. 

## duration
30 minutes, no longer. If it tends to stretch longer, there wasn't enough preparation around content. 

## content 
* If pre-product, founder presents market hypotheses and how they intend to test them.
* If product but pre-revenue, founder presents product-market hypotheses and small feature tests to run that week.
* If product is $1-10k MRR growing 10% WoW+, how to find more customers
* If product is $1-10k MRR and growing < 10% WoW,  

## preparation
* A 1-5 bullet list of major hypotheses, customer development related tests

## retrospectives
* Quarterly & annual assessment of the process to date, evolution as progress from 10k MRR, 50k MRR, >100k MRR+ / weekly growth 5%+, 10%+ / retention improvements.
